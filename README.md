A collection of my own implementations of various data structures and algorithms. 


Reminder, to compile, add compiler .exe to path and run specific commands. 

For the g++ compiler, we run `g++ <file_path_and_name>.cpp`. That will generate the default `a.exe`, which can be run immediatelty after. Typically, you will want to link header files and other object files, which can be a messy process. You'll need to look into tools that simplify the build process.
